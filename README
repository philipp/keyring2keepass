Simple XML stylesheet to convert from gnu keyring (palm os) XML file to a keeypass 2.x XML file.

Inspired by http://github.com/rocketraman/keyring-to-keypassx/tree/master

I needed this when my Clie finally died and I switched to a BlackBerry (I still miss PalmOS)

To export a Palm pdb file to XML, download export.jar from

http://gnukeyring.sourceforge.net/conduits.html
  (currently (2009-08-23) the jar file is at: http://hoenicke.ath.cx/keyring2-pre/export.jar )

Execute the export e.g.

java -jar export.jar Keys-Gtkr.pdb password > keyring.xml

It should create an XML file with the form:

<pwlist>
  <pwentry>
    <title></title>
    <category></category>
    <username></username>
    <password></password>
    <notes></notes>
    <lastmodtime></lastmodtime>
  </pwentry>
</pwlist>

Execute the stylesheet with an XSLT v2 processor, such as Saxon e.g.

(
I went to http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/ and got the latest version (saxonhe9-2-0-2j.zip as of 2009-08-23) and extracted saxon9he.jar
But any other older or presumably newer saxon9.jar should work, or other XSLT v2 processor to which you might have access.
)

java -jar saxon9he.jar -xsl:keyring-to-keepass.xsl -s:keyring.xml -o:keepass.xml

This will convert it into keepass.xml

The keepass.xml file should be importable into KeePass 2.x via: File -> Import... -> KeePass XML (2.x)
One group will be created for each category in keyring.

keyring-to-keepass1.xsl can be used in the same way to convert to KeePass
1.x format. This is useful if you want to use KeePassX on Linux or Mac.
